# Data-Science-Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only.

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1.Install dependencies using requirements.txt.

2.Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.

### Machine Learning
[Unsupervised Learning:Wheat Export analysis:](https://github.com/Ganeshdhanawade/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Project%203%20Wheat%20Export.ipynb)
Our objective is to cluster the countries based on various sales data provided to us across years. We have to apply an unsupervised learning technique like K means or Hierarchical clustering so as to get the final solution. But before that we have to bring the exports (in tons) of all countries down to same scale across years. Plus, as this solution needs to be repeatable we will have to do PCA so as to get the principal components which explain max variance.

[Supervised Learning:Breast Cancer Detection analysis:](https://github.com/Ganeshdhanawade/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Breast_Cancer_Detection_Using_Machine_Learning_Classifier.ipynb)
Using logistic regression to predict the tummer is present or not.Using XGboost classifier model gives an 98% accuracy.
